How much time does an average insertion consume in the Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?
The tree is little less than 3 times slower than the heap.

How much time does finding 50000 in the Binary Search Tree consume compared to the Heap?
It takes almost 5 times more time to find the target in the tree compared to the heap.

How much time does the average deletion consume in a Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?
it take about 5 times more time to delete in the tree compared tot the heap.

When would you use a Binary Search Tree and why?
I would use a BST where I needed to find insert or delete a specific data structure when
speed and efficiency are not as important.

When would you use an Heap and why?
I would use a heap when speed and efficiency was more important that anything else.
